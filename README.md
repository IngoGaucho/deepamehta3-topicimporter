Topic Importer Functionality
============================

**1st:** creating a bunch of topics right away and **2nd:** allowing one-time-import of simple data structures like, e.g. HTML Tables copied via the clipboard 

**Usage & Configuration:** Start this Plugin via Menu Item *Special* and then *Topic Importer*... after provding input press *Go* below. After you provided some input and made some decent mousemoves the preview of imported values will be updated.

**Default Behaviour:** One Topic Name = One Line in the Multiline Input Field

*Special 1: All imported items will have the type of the currently selected TopicType

*Special 2: Create automatically associations in between all imported topics and one pre-selected topic of the current topicmap

*Special 3: Allow to define regular expressions with a preview area to validate data input
